## Features

Why Whitespace!?

- Turing complete — well, probably.
- ~~Large eco-system with thousands upon thousands of modules~~.
- Your code looks actually *clean*.


## How does it work?

Whitespace uses three whitespace characters from the ASCII encoding:

- `0x20` — `SPC`
- `0x0a` — `LF`
- `0x09` — `TAB`
- *Everything else* is a comment.


## How does it work?

Execution works by applying instructions to a Stack Machine

- Stack: `Push Duplicate Swap Drop Copy Slide`
- Heap: `Store Fetch`
- Arithmetic: `+` ` ` `-` ` ` `×` ` ` `÷` ` ` `Modulo`
- FlowControl: `Tag Call Jump JumpIfZero JumpIfNegative Return Exit`
- InputOutput: `ReadCharacter ReadNumber WriteCharacter WriteNumber`


## How does it work?

\vspace{-1cm}
There is one type of data in Whitespace:

- Signed Integers…
- …of arbitrary size.
- Literals in program text use signed-magnitude binary encoding.
- Used for: Data (Numbers and Characters), Addresses (Stack and Heap), etc.

## How does it work?

Similarly, labels are strings like that as well:

- There is just one name space, and labels have to be unique.
- So you can't use the same label in two `Tag` calls.

\vspace{1.5cm}

- Some code uses multiples of eight as the bits in the labels…
- …treat the datum as an unsigned integer…
- …then they map that to ASCII: The example here would be `0x55` → `U`
- That is not at all required: `[SPC][LF]` is a perfectly fine label.

## How does it work?

Virtual Machine Design:

- Stack memory — Main argument memory for most instructions
- Heap memory — Utility memory
- Program memory — The actual code to run
- Program Counter — The index into program memory
- Jump Table — For all the `Jump` and `Call` instructions
- Call Stack — Because there are the `Call` and `Return` instruction


## How about implementing it?

```.haskell
data WhitespaceMachine = WhitespaceMachine
  {
    stack     :: Stack,
    callStack :: Stack,
    heap      :: Heap,
    pc        :: Address,
    jump      :: JumpTable,         -- Maps a Label to an Address
    program   :: WhitespaceProgram  -- [WhitespaceExpression]
  } deriving (Show, Eq)
```


## How about implementing it?

```.haskell
data WhitespaceExpression = StackManipulation StackOperation
                          | Arithmetic ArithmeticOperation
                          | HeapAccess HeapOperation
                          | FlowControl FlowControlOperation
                          | InputOutput InputOutputOperation

data FlowControlOperation = Tag Label
                          | Call Label
                          | Jump Label
                          | JumpIfZero Label
                          | JumpIfNegative Label
                          | Return
                          | ExitFromProgram
```


## How about implementing it?

```.haskell
  [ StackManipulation (Push 11),
    StackManipulation (Push 33),
    Arithmetic Add,
    InputOutput PrintNumber,
    FlowControl ExitFromProgram ]
```

…what is left to do?


## How about implementing it?

```.haskell
whitespaceParser :: Parser WhitespaceExpression
whitespaceParser =
  (    StackManipulation  <$> stackParser)
  <|> (Arithmetic         <$> arithmeticParser)
  <|> (HeapAccess         <$> heapParser)
  <|> (FlowControl        <$> flowControlParser)
  <|> (InputOutput        <$> ioParser)

heapParser :: Parser HeapOperation
heapParser = do
  (      try $ imp       [ WS.tabular, WS.tabular ])
  (      try $ operation [ WS.space   ] Store)
    <|> (try $ operation [ WS.tabular ] Fetch)
```


## How about implementing it?

```.haskell
module SpaceMan.Machine.Tools (
  psh, drp, peek, ref, -- Stack Memory Instructions
  sto, lda,            -- Heap Memory Instructions
  csp, csd, csa,       -- Call Stack Instructions
  pci, pcl, pcn, ldi,  -- Process Counter Instructions
  lbl)                 -- Jump Table Instructions
where
```


## How about implementing it?

```.haskell
jmp :: WhitespaceMachine -> Label -> Predicate -> IO WhitespaceMachine
jmp m tag p = return $ pcl n $ drp 1 m
  where a = lbl tag m
        [v] = peek 1 m
        n = if (p v) then a else pcn m

eval :: WhitespaceMachine -> FlowControlOperation -> IO WhitespaceMachine
eval m (Tag _)              = return $ pci m
eval m (Call tag)           = return $ pcl a $ csp m where a = lbl tag m
eval m (Jump tag)           = return $ pcl a m       where a = lbl tag m
eval m (JumpIfZero tag)     = jmp m tag (== 0)
eval m (JumpIfNegative tag) = jmp m tag (<  0)
eval m Return               = return $ pcl a $ csd m where a = 1+(csa m)
eval _ ExitFromProgram      = exitSuccess
```

## That's all folks!

That was…

- what Whitespace *is*.
- what it can *do*.
- what its values *look* like.
- how to *design* a virtual machine for it.
- how its program's intermediate representation can be *expressed*.
- how to *parse* program text into that representation.
- how the virtual machine can *run* that representation.
- seeing it *work*.
